## Hi there!
Hi i'm Marco, a computer engineering student.    
I enjoy middle-distance running, F1, and studying physiology.  
Still I don't know why I took engineering and decided to be a software engineer.

Currently I'm working as mobile and front-end developer.
Mobile it's fun, so much topics to learn but it's fun, I swear.

That's all :)
